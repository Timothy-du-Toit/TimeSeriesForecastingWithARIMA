# A starting note before the critique:

It appears as though new SA  COVID-19 cases are no longer being recorded on WorldOMeters] https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-africa/). 
As such, for the past while, the daily increase in the number of cases has been set to 0. 
You can exclude this when running my script by modifying the `exclude_days` value in `main.py`. 
I recommend `exclude_days = 400` to better demonstrate the predictive capabilities of this model

# Critique:
## The Model Itself

The ARIMA model benefits from careful selection of its three key parameters (p,d,q). These are currently set to (3,1,0) in the code.
These parameters can be set using a broad collection of analytical processes - both qualitative and quantitative.
In assessing the COVID-19 dataset, I identified that the model would benefit from a lagged viewing window of 3 observations (p=3) and a difference order of 1 (d=1).
However, too late to implement, I came across an alternative assessment approach that indicated that a window of 5 observations (p=5) would result in a smaller RMSE/overall error. 
It would be worth reviewing in future, given more time, if this would indeed result in a significant improvement. 
## Performance
Currently, the script recreates the model instead of saving it for later prediction use. This slows down future-reaching predictions as the model needs to be recreated. 

## Data Usage:
As mentioned in my brief preface, it appears as though WorldOMeters SA COVID-19 data is no longer being updated. It would be beneficial to combine data from multiple sources, 
as well as a measure of what proportion of cases may be inaccurately reported.
